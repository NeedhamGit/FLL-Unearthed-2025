About Us

Let me introduce ourselves. This is Krish Mehta, Avi Saxena, Arjun Nair, Milin Doshi and we are the Lego robotics team called the code wizards.(Insert Name Here) was created to solve two archeological problems that often are affecting the people who work hard to restore our history. The main problem is when archaeologists attempt to transport artifacts from one place to another it might fall, get lost, get stolen, etc. The other problem is that funding for archeologists is low so that leads to bad equipment and the inability to even do the jobs that they like. This is why we created the company (insert name here) to sell our product, the Boulder. Our product is the latest and greatest, integrating aspects of engineering and science. It uses a handmade gyroscope to rotate and adjust instantaneously.

Funding Blurb

- We reduced materials in our product to make it cost-efficient
- Made the product so it is attachable to the truck
